3. Revenue peaked during early 2018 to mid 2019 and there is a noticeable decline after that observed especially in early 2020.
4. Electricalsara Stores contributes massively with 413.33M - over 40% revenue generation.
5. A product labelled as 'Blank' has had the highest sales - this indicates incomplete product information. Second highest sales was made by product code 'Prod040'.
